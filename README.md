**Connecting People with Lost Belongings**

A citizen network that reunites people with their lost belongings in minutes using AI-powered multi-agent technology.

## Overview

ItemRadarAI is an innovative platform designed to connect residents of any city with individuals who find lost items, streamlining the recovery process and providing valuable insights into loss patterns across urban environments.

### Key Features

- **For Lost Item Owners**: Conversational chatbot accessible via WhatsApp, web, or mobile app that matches descriptions or photos with found items in seconds
- **For Item Finders**: Simple photo capture with GPS location upload to instantly add items to the database
- **For Municipalities**: Analytical dashboards displaying loss hotspots, peak times, and item categories to optimize urban cleaning and safety operations

## How It Works

ItemRadarAI operates through a sophisticated multi-agent AI system:

### 1. **Lens Agent** (For Finders)
- Captures photo, geolocation, and timestamp
- Extracts detailed descriptions using Gemini Vision
- Generates embeddings and stores in Firestore with Vertex AI Vector Search

### 2. **Chatbot Agent** (For Owners)
- Engages in natural dialogue to understand the lost item
- Generates accurate descriptions and corresponding embeddings
- Publishes description-ready events to the system

### 3. **ItemMatcher Agent**
- Queries Vertex AI Vector Search to retrieve top matching candidates
- Returns ranked results based on similarity scores

### 4. **Reducer Agent**
- Handles multiple matches by generating discriminative questions
- Examples: "Does it have handles?", "What color is the strap?"

### 5. **Filter**
- Applies user responses to refine candidate lists
- Iterates until reaching either one match or no matches

### 6. **Results**
- **Single Match**: Notifies both users with pickup instructions
- **No Match**: Informs user and offers optional future notifications
